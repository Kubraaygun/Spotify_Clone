# Spotify Clone Project

This project is a music discovery and listening application that aims to provide the best music listening experience on mobile devices. Users can get detailed information about songs and albums, play music, and use a powerful search function to discover. The project is built with modern mobile development techniques and aims to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Purpose of the Project

In this project, a music discovery and listening application has been developed using React Native. The application aims to learn about songs and albums, listen to music, and provide users with different features related to music. In addition, one of the main goals of the project is to provide global state management using the Context API. In this way, it has become easier to share and manage information such as user information and album data on different screens of the application.

## Features

- **Song and Album Search:** Users can search by a specific artist, album or song title.

- **Music Playback:** The app includes features to play, pause and stop music. Controls can also be provided over the song being played.

- **Album and Artist Details:** Users can access detailed information about an album and view artist information.
- **Profile Management:** Users can create and edit their personal profiles.
- **Responsive Design:** The app has a responsive design that works well on both iOS and Android platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native:** A framework used for developing mobile applications. It allows the development of applications that work on both iOS and Android platforms.

- **React Navigation:** A library used to switch between screens. It makes it easier to navigate between pages in the application.

- **Axios:** A library used to retrieve data from the API. It is used in this project to retrieve song data.

- **React Context API:** React Context API is used to provide global state management throughout the application. In this way, data such as user information, album data and artist information can be shared throughout the application.

- **Shazam API:** An API used for song search operations. With this API, users can quickly get information by song name or artist name.

- **TrackPlayer:** A library used to provide music playback features. It can perform operations such as playing, pausing and stopping songs.

- **Linear Gradient:** A library used to provide an aesthetic color transition in the background. It increases the visual appeal of the application.

## Application Structure

- **Global State Management:** The application provides global state management using the React Context API. In this way, user data, album data and artist information used on different pages can be managed centrally.

- **Screens and Navigation:** The application navigates between different screens using React Navigation. Users can easily navigate between screens such as the home page, song details, and profile page.

- **User Interactions:** The application monitors user interactions and responds appropriately to music playback. Features such as playing, pausing, and stopping songs work dynamically.

- **Responsive Design:** A responsive interface has been used for a compatible design on both iOS and Android platforms.
